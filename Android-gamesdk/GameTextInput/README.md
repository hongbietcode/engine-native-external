# Game Text Input library

Game Text Input is providing a simple API to show and hide the soft keyboard, set and get the currently editing text and receive notifications when the text is changed. It is not meant for fully-fledged text editor applications but still provides selection and composing region support for typical game use-case.

## Build the GameTextInput AAR from sources

From the "gamesdk" directory:

* `./gradlew packageLocalZip -Plibraries=game_text_input`

The AAR is output in the `package` directory.

## Integrate GameTextInput AAR to your build

Refer to the integration guide for now. Link to it and other documentation will be added here later.
